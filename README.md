## PHP Educational Interaction System

This was written as part of our semester project and is written in PHP without any framework. Has couple of features and provides ideas for learning basic web development ideas.

Many things have changed since then, web has evolved a lot, HTML5/CSS3 are now widely used and supported by browsers, several PHP frameworks evolved, PHP Community grew stronger. So, a lot of code here might not look very good but does serve the learning purpose.

Most of the stuffs here are written from scratch so a good codebase for learners. Apart from that, this system can be utilized by educational institutes and colleges as an interaction system.
